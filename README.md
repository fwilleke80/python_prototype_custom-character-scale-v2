A prototype written with PyGame to test different approaches of interpolating between values associated with arbitrarily distributed points.

## Supported weighting modes
* Inverse linear
* Inverse square
* Exponential
* Gaussian
* Max-Nearby influence
* Weighted median
* Harmonic mean

Adds a point, or removes an existing point.

## Right mouse click
Edits the value of an existing point.

## Key "B"
Cycles through weighting modes.

## Key "SPACE"
Regenerates point random positions and weights.

## Key "UP"
Adds a new point with random position and weight.

## Key "DOWN"
Removes the last added point.
